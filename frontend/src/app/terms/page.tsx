            Welcome to Opi Trade. By using this website or interacting with our smart contracts, you agree
            to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please discontinue use immediately.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Non-Custodial Service</h2>
          <p>
            Opi Trade is a non-custodial application. You retain full control of your digital assets at all times.
            We do not hold or custody funds, and you are solely responsible for safeguarding your wallet,
            private keys, and assets.
          </p>
  
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Trading Risks</h2>
          <p>
            Cryptocurrency and digital asset trading involves significant risk. Prices can fluctuate rapidly,
            and you may lose some or all of your investment. Nothing on this site should be construed as
            financial advice. You trade at your own risk.
          </p>
  
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">No Liability</h2>
          <p>
            Opi Trade provides software “as is,” without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for
            any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of our
            platform, including but not limited to trading losses or smart contract vulnerabilities.
          </p>
  
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Withdrawals</h2>
          <p>
            Since Opi Trade is non-custodial, you may withdraw your assets at any time. All transactions
            occur directly on the blockchain and are final once confirmed.
          </p>
  
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Restricted Jurisdictions</h2>

          <p>
            You agree not to use VPNs, proxies, or other methods to disguise your location in order to
            bypass geographic restrictions. Any attempt to do so constitutes a violation of these Terms
            and may result in termination of your access.
          </p>
  
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">User Responsibility</h2>
